<b>Description</b><p>

<p>Metamodel, XMI transformations and metric definitions for
Gentleware Poseidon for UML V4.0 and V4.1.</p>

<p>Poseidon 4 uses the UML2.0 metamodel for statechart diagrams,
sequence diagrams, and activity diagrams. The other diagram types
still use a UML1.x meta model, in particular collaboration diagrams
still use UML1.x objects, links, and stimuli. Other peculiarities
of the XMI exporter include:</p>

<ul>
<li>In the XMI files, element types from the UML1.4 metamodel use
namespace "UML", element types from UML2 use namespace "UML2".</li>
<li>Object and control flows in UML2 activity graphs are not differentiated
in the XMI file, both are encoded with UML2:ActivityEdge elements.
Consequently, metrics and design rules that take this difference into
account no longer apply. For some reason, object nodes are encoded with
UML2:Pin, and there are instances of UML2:CallAction.
ActivityEdge, Pin, and CallAction are abstract in the UML2 metamodel, so
there should not be any instances of these types.</li>
<li>Types of (UML1.4!) attributes and parameters no longer are encoded
with the usual UML:Parameter.type and UML:StructuralFeature.type elements,
but with a UML2:TypedElement.type element. So they managed to mix UML1
and UML2 in a single model element now...</li>
</ul>

<p>The XMI transformation file takes these details into account.</p>
